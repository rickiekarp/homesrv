                    <h3>Goodgame Studios</h3><br><br>
                        When I worked at Goodgame Studios I mainly worked on the BigFarm browser game.
                        <br>This is a farming simulator where players build up farms and produce/sell products.<br>
                        <br>I was responsible for assuring the quality by testing the game, reporting bugs and helping my colleagues with questions in regards to software quality.
                        <br><br>Additionally to that I was also doing the following:
                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                            <li>
                                Maintaining the bug database
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Creating and improving test plans
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Ensuring optimal communication between QA and Development
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Giving feedback in regards to game design
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Writing test reports
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Creating and analysing test statistics
                            </li>
                        </ul>
