                <h3>Hi, I'm Rickie!</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a passionate software developer with multiple years experience working in the video game industry. 
                    I have worked on multiple PC and Mobile games (both free-to-play and buy-to-play) through all stages of development.

                <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
                    Throughout my career I have always shown a high level of initiative and commitment towards the different projects
                    and worked hard to achieve the best possible results.
